# Task 13 - Theme Setup

## Goal
Define the app's base color and typography system in Compose.

## Steps
1. Create `ui/theme/Color.kt` with brand colors.
2. Create `ui/theme/Type.kt` with typography styles.
3. Create `ui/theme/Theme.kt` to combine colors, typography, and shapes.
4. Apply theme in `MainActivity`.

## Output
- All screens render with consistent typography and color.

## Notes
This is not final UI design; it is base styling only.
